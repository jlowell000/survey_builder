# survey_builder

A personal Typescript project. Going to be trying to create and application that allows a user to create a survey with more logic than a simple form (ex. branching paths based on previous answers).

to build simply:
      
      npm install
      gulp
      
npm should pull in the dependecies and gulp handles the build. The `gulpfile.js` has conditional string to control local vs deployable builds.
